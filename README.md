# FishingShopFinalTask
# Project Overview
The web application provides an opportunity to buy one or several products of different types for fishing. The application works as an online store, where a registered user can collect a cart and place an order. The manager processes orders (can cancel the order, or send for execution), and also changes and adds goods. For various reasons, the manager can block the user. The administrator can create new managers and block/unblock users.
